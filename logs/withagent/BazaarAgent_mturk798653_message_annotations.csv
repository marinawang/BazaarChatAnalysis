I think that relying as MINIMALLY as possible on Coal energy is important in order to be environmentally friendly, thus Plan 1 is not feasible. Plan 2 then has the lowest overall startup cost, making it an attractive option.",PLAN+GIVING_OPINION+PLAN2+PLAN1+pos

2016-06-03,21:26:21,0,Miri,1465003581741,I agree with Zak. Plan 1 is the cheapest but comes with a ton of pollution and waste issues. It's really not feasible.

2016-06-03,21:34:34,0,Miri,1465004075819,Anything other than Plan 1 seems to be best in terms of carbon neutrality. Plans 2 and 4 are especially nice because of the heavier reliance on renewable natural energy sources that don't require heavy waste disposal. They're also both better economically because the city won't have to spend money dealing with pollution or any damage to the environment that waste storage or nuclear accidents might cause. (Though Plan 2 would probably be the best of the two because of its lower yearly cost.),PLAN2+AUDIO_SOURCE+PLAN1+GIVING_ORIENTATION+POSITIVITY+NEGATIVE+PLAN+pos+GIVING_OPINION
