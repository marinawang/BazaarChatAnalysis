That was the step where you were asked to write an individual proposal and post it to the discussion forum. Work towards a consensus on which plan you think is the best as a group. Wherever possible, supplement plan suggestions, agreements and disagreements with reasons, and try to refer to or build upon your teammates' ideas."

40,text,Ang,72.192.90.21:61941,8,2016-06-08 21:27:59,mturkno722681,I was thinking Plan 3 because there is no toxic chemical waste
45,text,Hannah,173.74.182.189:62831,7,2016-06-08 21:28:18,mturkno722681,I went ahead with plan 4 mainly because of the higher % of nuclear waste

63,text,Hannah,173.74.182.189:62831,7,2016-06-08 21:29:45,mturkno722681,So you chose plan 2 then Ang?
64,text,Ang,72.192.90.21:61941,8,2016-06-08 21:29:46,mturkno722681,ok based on just the toxic waste part that would take out number 1 and 3.... and leave 2 and 4
