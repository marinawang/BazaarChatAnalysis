That was the step where you were asked to write an individual proposal and post it to the discussion forum. Work towards a consensus on which plan you think is the best as a group. Wherever possible, supplement plan suggestions, agreements and disagreements with reasons, and try to refer to or build upon your teammates' ideas."

47,text,Gerald,173.29.135.99:57948,7,2016-06-03 21:29:23,mturkno798652,plan 3 relies heavily on nuclear power which is dependent on shrinking uranium deposits so I don&#39;t think it works for long run.  I think 2 or 4 is good
48,text,Eddy,76.104.224.126:55156,9,2016-06-03 21:29:30,mturkno798652,My vote is for either plan 2 or 3
