That was the step where you were asked to write an individual proposal and post it to the discussion forum. Work towards a consensus on which plan you think is the best as a group. Wherever possible, supplement plan suggestions, agreements and disagreements with reasons, and try to refer to or build upon your teammates' ideas."

68,text,Pat,107.178.47.68:57276,37,2016-06-10 21:27:32,mturkno7226105,Then their will have to be a trade off for the most important feature. Envionmetal vs price
71,text,William,24.28.143.83:52889,42,2016-06-10 21:27:42,mturkno7226105,I think that # 2 is the most cost-effective AND environmentally friendly. Wind farms can be built away from environmentally sensitive areas like migration routes and nesting areas
79,text,Pat,107.178.47.68:57276,37,2016-06-10 21:28:37,mturkno7226105,Ok i agree with #2 as well

86,text,Pat,107.178.47.68:57276,37,2016-06-10 21:29:37,mturkno7226105,Plus it has less coal and nuclear
87,text,pete,50.131.67.227:59819,23,2016-06-10 21:29:54,mturkno7226105,you want to risk killing off birds and losing tourism?

107,text,William,24.28.143.83:52889,42,2016-06-10 21:32:19,mturkno7226105,I think coal is a no go. Fossil fuels kill everything.
