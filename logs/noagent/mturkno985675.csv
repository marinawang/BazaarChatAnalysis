That was the step where you were asked to write an individual proposal and post it to the discussion forum. Work towards a consensus on which plan you think is the best as a group. Wherever possible, supplement plan suggestions, agreements and disagreements with reasons, and try to refer to or build upon your teammates' ideas."

Yes it is expensive, but focusing on nuclear power has more benefits with the only cost removing the waste, but it is still reasonably priced"

39,text,Rose,67.163.208.43:64669,20,2016-06-07 21:28:36,mturkno985675,I prefer Plan 2 as it utilizes wind energy -- which is the most environmentally friendly -- yet only plan 1 seems to fit the budget. 
40,text,blake,173.191.60.233:60990,25,2016-06-07 21:28:38,mturkno985675,I believe plan 2 to be the best over all and for the future. 
47,text,Rose,67.163.208.43:64669,20,2016-06-07 21:29:11,mturkno985675,I agree. I am sure we can reach some sort of middle ground. 
55,text,Rose,67.163.208.43:64669,20,2016-06-07 21:29:47,mturkno985675,I would be in favor of wind energy being the majority since something that is environmentally friendly seems to be a huge priority for this city.

You now have just 5 minutes to finalize a joint argument in favor of one plan and complete your proposal on the left. Keep in mind that you will be evaluated solely based on the quality of your proposal (i.e., the thoroughness of the reasoning displayed)."
