That was the step where you were asked to write an individual proposal and post it to the discussion forum. Work towards a consensus on which plan you think is the best as a group. Wherever possible, supplement plan suggestions, agreements and disagreements with reasons, and try to refer to or build upon your teammates' ideas."

9,text,mlsasc,108.219.110.10:51742,36,2016-06-12 17:57:35,mturkno7226123,Well plan 1 is the only one under their budget.
