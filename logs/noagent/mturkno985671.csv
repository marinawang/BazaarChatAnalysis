That was the step where you were asked to write an individual proposal and post it to the discussion forum. Work towards a consensus on which plan you think is the best as a group. Wherever possible, supplement plan suggestions, agreements and disagreements with reasons, and try to refer to or build upon your teammates' ideas."

19,text,GBF,24.13.20.253:57370,1,2016-06-07 21:25:00,mturkno985671,I like plan 2.  It&#39;s closest to the budge and with emphasis on wind its cleanest and costs will only go down.
21,text,thibodeauxs10,70.186.178.2:51467,39,2016-06-07 21:25:44,mturkno985671,"I think that Plan 2 is the best option here. This uses a majority of wind power, and a small amount of coal and nuclear power. I think that it&#39;s absolutely important to consider that we need to trade off on certain things in order to come to an agreement. "

34,text,toveck,71.61.48.46:61037,10,2016-06-07 21:27:49,mturkno985671,I think plan 2 would be the best although have to worry about keeping the birds safe it is the cheapest to start and is also very safe for the environment and get a tax credit

You now have just 5 minutes to finalize a joint argument in favor of one plan and complete your proposal on the left. Keep in mind that you will be evaluated solely based on the quality of your proposal (i.e., the thoroughness of the reasoning displayed)."

The nuclear power can be used for the hospital so it would have a secure source of power 24&#x2F;7. For the rest of the city, we could use both wind and hydro in order to sustain a low greenhouse gas emission rate. "
