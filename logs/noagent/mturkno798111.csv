That was the step where you were asked to write an individual proposal and post it to the discussion forum. Work towards a consensus on which plan you think is the best as a group. Wherever possible, supplement plan suggestions, agreements and disagreements with reasons, and try to refer to or build upon your teammates' ideas."
17,text,Chu,108.18.66.218:60378,12,2016-06-06 21:25:51,mturkno798111,I think plan 2 is the best one.
18,text,Chu,108.18.66.218:60378,12,2016-06-06 21:26:27,mturkno798111,Definitely not plan 1 if the city is worried about renewable energy. 
19,text,kg,76.3.4.77:52199,5,2016-06-06 21:26:45,mturkno798111,Good point chu.
21,text,Bishop,108.4.81.71:49160,6,2016-06-06 21:27:06,mturkno798111,"The requirements state that the city&#39;s budget is only $900,000,000 though. Plan 1 is the only one that is under cost. All of the others are over-budget."
22,text,MJ,107.15.36.214:51768,15,2016-06-06 21:27:10,mturkno798111,Plan 2 sounds good. The city will have to find an extra $21 million.
26,text,kg,76.3.4.77:52199,5,2016-06-06 21:27:45,mturkno798111,Yeah plan 1 may be best
30,text,Bishop,108.4.81.71:49160,6,2016-06-06 21:28:56,mturkno798111,"21 million seems like a pretty substantial amount of money to come up with on the fly. I do agree the plan 2 seems better based on all of their environmental concerns, but they still are using renewable sources of energy. It&#39;s just not the main source."
32,text,MJ,107.15.36.214:51768,15,2016-06-06 21:29:16,mturkno798111,"Yeah, too bad we don&#39;t have an option between plans 1 and 2."
34,text,Bishop,108.4.81.71:49160,6,2016-06-06 21:29:31,mturkno798111,Maybe they could slowly phase out the coal source in the coming years?
37,text,kg,76.3.4.77:52199,5,2016-06-06 21:30:00,mturkno798111,Yes they could be an option

39,text,MJ,107.15.36.214:51768,15,2016-06-06 21:30:16,mturkno798111,Very true. If they adopted plan 1 they would have money to spend on more expensive plans in later years.
41,text,kg,76.3.4.77:52199,5,2016-06-06 21:30:48,mturkno798111,yes good point
42,text,Bishop,108.4.81.71:49160,6,2016-06-06 21:30:50,mturkno798111,"Yeah, that&#39;s a good point. They could bank the remaining funds and put it towards increasing the use of water, wind, or nuclear."
45,text,Chu,108.18.66.218:60378,12,2016-06-06 21:31:11,mturkno798111,You may need to consider in the long run how much the pollution that plan 1 will cost. 
47,text,Chu,108.18.66.218:60378,12,2016-06-06 21:31:47,mturkno798111,Though I&#39;m not sure because it isn&#39;t stated.

82,text,Bishop,108.4.81.71:49160,6,2016-06-06 21:36:02,mturkno798111,I think that might fit well under the trade-off?
