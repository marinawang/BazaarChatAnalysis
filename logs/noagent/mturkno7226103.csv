That was the step where you were asked to write an individual proposal and post it to the discussion forum. Work towards a consensus on which plan you think is the best as a group. Wherever possible, supplement plan suggestions, agreements and disagreements with reasons, and try to refer to or build upon your teammates' ideas."
